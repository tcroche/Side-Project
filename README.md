# Side-Project
This repository gathers my personal side projects in **quantitative finance** and **financial data analysis**.
The goal is to build **end-to-end, recruiter-friendly projects**: clean data pipelines, robust research, and reproducible results.

### 2) Build a shell
**Goal:** learn how a shell reads, parses, and runs commands, what a REPL is and how it works under the hood and how running commands require spawning OS processes and exits
