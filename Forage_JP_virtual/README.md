# JPMorgan Chase – Quantitative Research Virtual Experience (Forage)

This project is part of the **JPMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience** on Forage.
It focuses on **financial data analysis, pricing, and risk modeling**, reproducing realistic tasks encountered on a quantitative research desk.

## Task 1 — Natural Gas Price Analysis & Extrapolation

### Objective
Analyze historical monthly natural gas prices and build a model capable of:
- estimating the price at any past date,
- extrapolating prices one year into the future.

## Task 2 — Gas Storage Contract Pricing Model

### Objective
Develop a **prototype pricing model** for a natural gas storage contract, intended for further validation before production use.

## Task 3 — Credit Risk Modeling (PD & Expected Loss)

### Objective
Build a model that estimates the **Probability of Default (PD)** for a borrower and computes the **Expected Loss (EL)** of a loan.

## Task 4 — Credit Rating Construction via Quantization

### Objective
Create a **rating system** that maps borrower FICO scores to discrete credit ratings,
where a **lower rating corresponds to better credit quality**.
